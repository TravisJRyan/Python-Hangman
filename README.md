# Python-Hangman
A simple Python hangman game written for my CS170 class in Spring 2016 using Zelle Graphics library

Words are taken from the words text file. Images of Hangman progression were provided by professor.

Zelle's Graphics Library (graphics.py) is necessary to play the game. Can be found online here:
